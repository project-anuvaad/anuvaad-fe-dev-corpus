In  pursuance  of  an  order  dated  23  July  2018  of  this  Court  in  the  present  appeal,  the  Union  of  India  in  the  MoD  filed  an  affidavit  dated  4  May  2018.  The  Union of India states that the services in the Army are classified into three broad  categories:  (i)  Combat  Arms;  (ii)  Combat  Support  Arms;  and  (iii)  Services.  SSC  for  women  was  available  only  in  Combat  Support  Arms  and  Services.  Combat  Arms  have  been  excluded  for  SSC  appointments  for  women  in  the  Army.  The  judgment  of  the  Delhi  High  Court  has  also  affirmed  this  position.  In  2008,  the  benefit  of  PC  was  extended  to  SSC  women  officers  in  the  JAG  and  AEC  which  belonged to the Services stream. As a consequence of the judgment of the Delhi  High Court, it has been held that in all streams where the Army has provided the  option for SSC women officers, there should be no impediment for extending the  option  for  the  conferment  of  PCs.  The  effect  of  the  judgment  is  that  all  SCC  women  officers  in  different  disciplines  in  the  Combat  Support  Arms  and  in  the  Services  category  to  whom  the  judgment  applies  have  continued  in  service  beyond  the  maximum  permissible  term  of  fourteen  years  as  SSC  officers.",

The  nature  of  duties is similar to male officers.  Having served shoulder to shoulder with  male  officers  for  twenty-five  years,  the  contention  advanced  by  the  Union  of India with respect to battlefield scenarios lacks substance;  ",

The  women  officers  have  been  and  are  regularly  being  posted  by  the  Indian  Army  to  all  possible  field  units  (combat  zones)  where  male  officers  from  the  same  corps  are  also  serving.  Consequently,  the  Army  follows  a  policy  of  non-discrimination  when  it  comes  to  postings  but  does  not  follow  the  same  when  it  comes  to  granting  PC  to  its  women  officers.  Thirty percent of all women officers are posted in the field (combat zones);  (iv)   Based  on  the  response  to  a  question  raised  in  the  Lok  Sabha,  as  on  16  August  2010,  there  is  an  acute  shortage  of  11,500  officers  in  the  Indian  Army out of which approximately 5,115 officers are deficient in the support  services  in  which  women  officers  have  been  commissioned.  Despite  the  deficiency of officers in the support services, the Indian Army is letting go  of  trained  women  officers  due  to  gender  discrimination  and  not  granting  PCs  to  women  officers.  To  overcome  the  shortage  of  officers,  the  Army  has given re-employment to retired male officers of the rank of Colonel or  below  at  the  age  of  superannuation  (54-58  years)  for  a  period  of  four  years. The vacancies in the Indian Army can be easily handled by women  officers; ",
